# SovereignVault: High-Performance SSE Core 🇸🇦

A specialized **Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE)** engine implemented in C++, designed for high-frequency data environments requiring strict privacy and sub-microsecond latency.

## 🚀 Performance & Benchmarks
In a controlled environment (GitHub Codespaces), the engine achieved the following results:
- **Search Latency:** ~0.000631 ms
- **Time Complexity:** O(1) for search operations via Hash-based indexing.
- **Optimization:** Compiled with `-O3` flags for maximum execution efficiency.

## 🛡️ Security Architecture
The system implements a **Blind Indexing** approach:
1. **Data Sovereignty:** Keywords are transformed into unique "Blind Tokens" before indexing.
2. **Zero-Knowledge Search:** The server/database performs matching on tokens without having access to the raw underlying data.
3. **PDPL Alignment:** Designed to meet the technical requirements of the Saudi Personal Data Protection Law regarding data minimization and encryption.

## 🏗️ Potential Applications
- **Critical Infrastructure (Aramco):** Real-time monitoring of encrypted sensor data.
- **Smart Cities (NEOM):** Scalable, privacy-preserving data indexing for urban intelligence.
- **National Security (SDAIA):** Enabling secure search across sensitive national datasets.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** C++17/20
- **Data Structures:** Optimized `std::unordered_map` for constant-time lookups.
- **Timing:** `std::chrono` high-resolution clock for nanosecond precision.
